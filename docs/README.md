# Documentation

## GIFs

To generate GIFs use [terminalizer app](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer). Install it, create `config.yml` file and record the terminal. After all edit the generated `*.yml` files to adjust the visuals and time delays. You can be inspired by already generated `*.yml` files. Generate GIF file running:

```sh
terminalizer render {YOUR_GIF_NAME}
```

## Swagger API

To edit the Swagger API use [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/). Copy the `api.yaml` file into the editor and adjust it.
